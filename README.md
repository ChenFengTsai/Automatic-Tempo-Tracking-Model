# Automatic-Tempo-Tracking-Model
## Overview
* Utilized Python and package sklearn, pytorch, librosa to build LSTM model to process melspectrogram and learn to classify tempo, used for automatic tempo tracking
* Integrated TempoTracking model into BeatTracking model to improve the performance of the latter
